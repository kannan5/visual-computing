In Our Artwork Case I've used all the cases of thresholding. 

THRESH_BINARY
THRESH_BINARY_INV
THRESH_OTSU
THRESH_BINARY_INV + THRESH_OTSU
ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C
THRESH_TRUNC
GAUSS+OTSU

From All these thresholding which I found some thresholding results interesting and It is optimal for retreive the data from the image 
1. Adaptive thresh gaussian In which produce the good results but the Adaptive thresholding is very good for various different light condition in Our case Artwork is different
2.In THRESH_BINARY_INV which is quite impressive it returns the whole image data, which is really good
3. In third case THRESH_BINARY_INV + THRESH_OTSU which returns all the text data in the artwork images In which i thinks Great!!!
