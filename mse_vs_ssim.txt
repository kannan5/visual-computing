In MSE when i feed the same input image data it perfectly showss 0.0 But in SSIM even i feed the same image data it still shows 1.0 
In MSE when value increases the image are less similar but in  SSIM where smaller value indicate less similarity.
I tried image with rotated with 180 degree still both shows the same results.
when i feed the the same image vs same image + overlay of another image it result : MSE value decrease when its compared to contrasted image compare value 
but the SSIM does something different the value of SSIM when it compared to contrasted image compare value 
if accuracy matters we should go with SSIM, sreenivas but it cost some performance when compared to MSE
